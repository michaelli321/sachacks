    <p class="display-4">Predictive Models</p>

    <p class="lead">From the insights we found in the data, we were able to perform predictive modeling on the data.
    The objective of our work was to identify the best archetype for each player position that would give the highest
    likelihood of winning the game. Through our analysis, we noticed that best archetype for winning a game is dependent
    on the opponent as well as the playing team. </p>

    <p class="h3">1. Recommendation Engine:</p>
    <p class="h5">What team should you select given the opponent's team?</p>

    <p class="lead"> We created a recommendation engine/predictive tool for predicting what the best archetype line-up
    was given an opposing team line-up. Given the archetypes of all five positions of the opposing team,
    our model predicts the distribution over archetypes, with the highest probability given to the archetype of the position
    that will maximize the player's likelihood of winning over the opponent's team.
    </p>

    <p class="h5">Approach</p>
    First, we one hot encoded the five archetypes for each of the five players and created a one-hot-encoded
    vector of each of the teams that played in the 2K season. For our training set, we had every
    losing team as input, as the team that defeated them as output. This way, for any given input,
    we'd be predicting the team archetype distribution that would beat them, which translates
    well to our recommendation engine in recommending users of the tool the best team to
    select to beat a given opponent team.

    <p class="lead"> </p>

    <p class="h5">Results</p>
    The model ran with 91.73% cross validation accuracy.
    <br /><br /><p class="h6">Example 1</p>
    To provide concrete examples,
    one of the cases we tested was the case where the opponent played the team:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Rebounding Post Scorer</b>
    <br /><br />
    The optimal team archetype recommendation to go up against this team is:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Shot-creating Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>

    <br /><br />Given the data of past games, this is a highly effective recommendation, because the
    combination of Shot-creating Sharpshooter (Point Guards) and Slashing Rebounder for Center
    results in wins and primarily positive results.

    <br /><br /><p class="h6">Example 2</p>
    To provide concrete examples,
    one of the cases we tested was the case where the opponent played the team:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>
    <br /><br />
    The optimal team archetype recommendation to go up against this team is:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>

    <br /><br />Our predictive model recommendation engine found that the best team to go up against this team of heavy shooters/scorers, is an identical
    team of heavy shooters/scorers.
    <br /><br />In the future, we'd like to do more testing on the efficacy of our recommendations.

    <p class="h3">2. Game Outcome Predictor:</p><br />
    <p class="h5">Given the line-ups of 2 opposing teams, can we predict the outcome/winner?</p>

    <p class="lead"> Our game outcome predictive model take the archetype vectors of 2 opposing teams
    and predicts which team is more likely to win. The output is a 2-length vector of the probability of
    the first team winning, and the second entry is the probability of the second team winning.
    <br /><br /> Users of this tool can input two of their teams and examine the likelihood of either team winning
    and use these probabilities to establish some level of confidence on who they think will win the match. From our
    investigations, a probability of victory of 0.7 or greater is sufficient confidence to predict the winner of the game.
    </p>

    <p class="h5">Approach</p>
    For this predictor, we trained with a one-hot encoded vector of both teams, with the
    predicted output being a 2-length vector, with the first value being 0 or 1 if Team 1
    won, and the second value corresponding similarly to Team 2's result.

    <p class="lead"> </p>

    <p class="h5">Results</p>

    <p class="h6">Example 1</p>
    One example case is where the first team was:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Stretch Five</b>
    <br /><br />
    The second team was:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Sharpshooting Shot Creator</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Rebounding Athletic Finisher</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Rebounding Post Scorer</b>

    <br /><br />The model prediction for this game is that Team 1 will win with a probability of 0.01645013 and Team 2
    will win with a probability of 0.9880592. The outcome of the game was that Team 2 won, so the prediction was
    correct. The model achieves in sample accuracy of 100%.


    <br /><br /><p class="h6">Example 2</p>
    In this trial, the first team was:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Sharpshooting Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>

    The second team was:
    <br /><br />Point Guard: <b>Sharpshooting Playmaker</b>
    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Slashing Rim Defender</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>
    <br /><br />

    The model prediction for this game is that Team 2 will win with a probability of 0.04821634 and Team 1
    will win with a probability of 0.967725. The outcome of the game was that Team 1 won, so the prediction was
    correct. The model achieves in sample accuracy of 100%.

    <br /><br /><p class="h3">3. Recommendation: Optimal Players To Fill Rest of Team:</p>
    <p class="h5">Given fixed members of a team, who should the player add to the fill up
    the rest of the team.</p>

    <br />Shooting Guard: <b>Pure Sharpshooter</b>
    <br />Small Forward: <b>Shot-creating Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Sharpshooting Rim Protector</b>

    The predicted optimal Center is:
    <br />Center: <b>Slashing Rebounder</b>
    <br /><br />
    <p class="lead"> </p>

    <p class="h6">Example 2</p>

    <br />Small Forward: <b>Sharpshooting Slasher</b>
    <br />Power Forward: <b>Sharpshooting Rim Protector</b>
    <br />Center: <b>Rebounding Post Scorer</b>
